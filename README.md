## 1) PREDICTION USING SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING

● Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours

● This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

● You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool

● Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data

● What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

● Task submission:

Host the code on GitHub Repository (public). Record the code and output in a video. Post the video on YouTube Share links of code (GitHub) and video (YouTube) as a post on YOUR LinkedIn profile Submit the LinkedIn link in Task Submission Form when shared with you.





## 2) PREDICTION USING UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING

● From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

● Use R or Python or perform this task

● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

● Task submission:

## 6)  PREDICTION USING DECISION TREE ALGORITHM

● For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
